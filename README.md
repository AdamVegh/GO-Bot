## FAQ
1. The bot keeps trying to log in?
You may have invalid credentials or the login servers could be down. Verify your login details are correct and/or try again later.

2. I can't read the log fast enough, can you slow it down?
All log messages are saved to a text file on your computer at "C:\Users\{Your username}\GO Bot\Output\output.txt".
